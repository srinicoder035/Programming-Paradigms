Type-checking and type requirements are much tighter in Java.
For example:
1. Conditional expressions can be only boolean, not integral.
2. The result of an expression must be used.

Reason

All conditional expressions are boolean by default.
However,some languages like C,C++ allows us to use  numerical expressions or pointers as conditional expressions.
When a non-boolean expression is used as a conditional expression, they are implicitly converted into comparisions with zero.
This feature is not supported in many high level languages like Java and C# because it does not produce a clear code.
Furthermore, it results in another set of comparisons which slows down the rate of execution due to type conversions.

Example
1.To check variable is equal to zero

if(i == 0){
}

2.To check variable is null or not

if(i!=null){
}
