Examples of R-values that cannot be L-values

1.Expressions Eg- a+b,a-5
2.Constant values Eg- 1,2,3.5
3.Any function thata does not return a pointer.

Examples of L-values

1.The name of a variable that points to a memory location
2.The square bracket [] always yields an L-values
3.const object (specifically using the const keyword)

All l-values can be treated as r-values because l-values serve as an identity and anything that has an identity must evaluate to a value.
Since it evaluates to a value, we can say that any l-value is a r-value but the converse doesn't hold good.

Eg
    int a = 10;
    int b = a;  // here the lvalue a can be treated as a r-value
