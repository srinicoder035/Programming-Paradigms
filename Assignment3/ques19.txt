Like Python Ada also supports array slicing 

Example
Ada
with Text_IO;
 
procedure Main is
   Text : String := "ABCDE";
begin
   Text_IO.Put_Line (Text (2 .. 4));
end Main;

OUTPUT
BCD

Python
a="ABCDE"
print(a[2:4])

OUTPUT
CD

Difference with Python
1.Python uses 0 based indexing while Ada uses 1 based indexing.
2.Python doesn't include the last index while slicing while Ada includes the last index.

Applications
1.Finding top 10 ranks in a class.
2.Finding last 5 ranks in a class.
3.Finding a substring in a string.
4.Computations that involve ranges uses slicing.
