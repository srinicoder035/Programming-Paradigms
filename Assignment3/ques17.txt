Let us consider the language C++

Let us assume the integer data type has 32 bits(4 bytes).

For any n bit representation the max value that can be represented is 2^n -1. 

In that case the integer data type can hold values upto (2^32)-1.

The range for this integer datatype is from -(2^31) to (2^31)-1.

If we consider unsigned integer datatype the range is from 0 to (2^32)-1.

In both the cases of signed and unsigned integer the datatype can hold only upto factorial of 12. 
Beyond 12 it cannot hold values.

In that case the integer datatype cannot hold those values.
In case of unsigned integer some garbage value within the range gets thrown up.
In case of signed integer negative value or some positive garbage value get thrown up.

Incase of long long int, we can compute upto factorial of 20.

If we use Python we can compute factorial of any number because the integer in python can be arbitrarily large.
